Data: Paramater values to initialize the MCMC algorithm for the SNEASY+BRICK model.,,,,
,,,,
Notes: ,(1) The starting point parameter values correspond to values from past model calibrations.,,,
,"(2) For parameters without lower or upper bounds, a physically informed range was selected based on past calibrations (these bounds are only used to select an initial step size in the adaptive MCMC sampling algorithm).",,,
,(3) The initial MCMC step size set to 5% of the difference between a parameter's upper and lower bound.,,,
